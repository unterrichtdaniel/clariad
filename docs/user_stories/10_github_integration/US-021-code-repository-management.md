# US-021: Code Repository Management

**As a** software developer,  
**I want** the GitHub integration layer to effectively manage code repositories  
**So that** code changes are properly tracked and organized.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Repository Initialization
- Given a new project
- When the GitHub integration sets up the repository
- Then it should create appropriate directory structure
- And initialize with standard files (.gitignore, README.md, etc.)

### Scenario: Branch Management
- Given development workflow requirements
- When the GitHub integration manages branches
- Then it should create, update, and merge branches according to defined conventions
- And maintain appropriate branch protections

### Scenario: Pull Request Lifecycle
- Given code changes in a feature branch
- When the GitHub integration manages the PR process
- Then it should create, update, review, and merge PRs appropriately
- And maintain traceability to user stories

### Scenario: Code Commit Management
- Given code changes from the Development agent
- When the GitHub integration commits them
- Then it should create well-organized, atomic commits
- And include proper references to issues in commit messages

### Scenario: Repository Permissions
- Given different user roles in the project
- When the GitHub integration manages access
- Then it should apply appropriate permission levels
- And ensure secure access control

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Repository structure standards are defined
- [x] Branch management conventions are documented
- [x] PR process guidelines are specified
- [x] Commit message standards are established
- [x] Permission level requirements are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story is a foundational component that supports code management aspects of the Clariad system. The GitHub integration layer must provide reliable APIs for managing repository structure, branches, pull requests, and commits. It needs to enforce conventions and maintain traceability between code changes and the corresponding user stories or issues.
