# US-001: MCP Server Implementation

**As a** user,  
**I want** to interact with the Clariad system through Claude Desktop  
**So that** I can access specialized software development capabilities through a familiar interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: MCP Server Registration
- Given I have Claude Desktop installed
- When I configure the claude_desktop_config.json file with Clariad's MCP server
- Then the Clariad system should be registered with Claude Desktop
- And be accessible as a tool provider in conversations

### Scenario: Tool Invocation
- Given I am using Claude Desktop with Clariad configured
- When I ask Claude to perform a software development task
- Then Claude should invoke the appropriate Clariad tool
- And the system should route the request to the right agent

### Scenario: Result Integration
- Given Clariad has processed a tool request from Claude
- When the agent returns its results
- Then Claude should incorporate those results into its response
- And present a coherent reply to my request

### Scenario: Streaming Updates
- Given a Clariad agent is performing a lengthy operation
- When the operation is in progress
- Then I should receive real-time streaming updates
- And see incremental progress through Claude Desktop

### Scenario: Context Management
- Given I have had previous interactions with Clariad agents
- When I continue the conversation with a new request
- Then the system should maintain appropriate context from past interactions
- And respond with awareness of the conversation history

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] MCP protocol documentation has been reviewed
- [x] Claude Desktop configuration requirements are clear
- [x] Tool registration process is understood
- [x] Communication protocol (stdio) is established
- [x] Error handling requirements are specified

## Technical Notes

This user story requires implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can register with Claude Desktop and expose Clariad's specialized agents as tools. The server will communicate with Claude Desktop via standard input/output (stdio) and follow the MCP protocol specifications for tool invocation and result handling. Instead of using direct API connections to LLM providers, Clariad will leverage Claude Desktop's existing LLM connection.
