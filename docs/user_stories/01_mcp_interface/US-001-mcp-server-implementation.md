# US-001: MCP Server Implementation

**As a** user,  
**I want** to interact with the Clariad system through MCP-compatible clients  
**So that** I can use familiar interfaces like Claude Desktop or OpenWebUI.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Connection Establishment
- Given I have an MCP-compatible client
- When I initiate a connection to the Clariad system
- Then the system should establish a successful connection
- And acknowledge with a welcome message

### Scenario: Request Routing
- Given I am connected to the Clariad system
- When I send a request related to any development phase
- Then the system should route my request to the appropriate agent
- And return a response from that agent

### Scenario: Streaming Responses
- Given I have sent a request to the Clariad system
- When an agent is processing my request
- Then I should receive real-time streaming responses
- And see incremental progress updates

### Scenario: Tool Usage Format
- Given I have requested an action requiring tool usage
- When the agent uses GitHub or other integrated tools
- Then the tool usage should be properly formatted according to MCP protocol
- And the results should be presented clearly in the conversation

### Scenario: Conversation History
- Given I have had previous interactions with the system
- When I continue the conversation with a new request
- Then the system should maintain appropriate context from past interactions
- And respond with awareness of the conversation history

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] MCP protocol documentation has been reviewed
- [x] Connection requirements are clearly defined
- [x] Message format specifications are available
- [x] Error handling requirements are specified
- [x] Performance expectations are documented

## Technical Notes

This user story requires understanding the Model-Client Protocol (MCP) specifications and implementing a server that can route requests to the appropriate agents in the Clariad ecosystem. The MCP server will need to handle streaming responses and maintain conversation state across multiple interactions.
