# US-026: Multi-layered Error Handling

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** a robust multi-layered error handling strategy  
**So that** the system can recover from failures and maintain data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Error Classification
- Given different types of errors may occur
- When the error handling system detects an error
- Then it should classify it into an appropriate category
- And apply the corresponding handling strategy

### Scenario: Agent-level Error Handling
- Given an error occurs within an agent's operation
- When the agent's error handler processes it
- Then it should attempt appropriate recovery actions
- And maintain the agent's state integrity

### Scenario: Orchestrator-level Error Handling
- Given an agent fails to complete its task
- When the orchestrator detects the failure
- Then it should implement appropriate workflow recovery
- And decide whether to retry, use an alternative path, or notify the user

### Scenario: Integration Error Handling
- Given an error in an external integration (GitHub, LLM API)
- When the integration layer detects the failure
- Then it should implement retry with exponential backoff
- And provide appropriate fallback options

### Scenario: Error Reporting
- Given an error that requires attention
- When the error handling system processes it
- Then it should generate appropriate notifications
- And include sufficient context for diagnosis

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Error classification taxonomy is defined
- [x] Agent-level recovery strategies are documented
- [x] Orchestrator-level handling approaches are specified
- [x] Integration error procedures are established
- [x] Reporting requirements are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story is a foundational cross-cutting concern that affects all system components. The multi-layered error handling strategy should provide robust recovery mechanisms at different levels: individual agents, the orchestrator, and integration points. The system should be resilient to transient failures in external services, LLM API rate limits, and other potential issues while maintaining data integrity.
