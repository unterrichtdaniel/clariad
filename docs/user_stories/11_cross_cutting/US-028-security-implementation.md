# US-028: Security Implementation

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** the system to implement robust security measures  
**So that** sensitive information is protected and access is properly controlled.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Credential Management
- Given the need for access to external services
- When the system manages credentials
- Then it should use secure credential storage
- And never expose sensitive information in logs or outputs

### Scenario: Access Control
- Given different user roles and permissions
- When users interact with the system
- Then it should enforce appropriate access controls
- And restrict operations based on user permissions

### Scenario: Data Protection
- Given potentially sensitive project information
- When the system processes this information
- Then it should apply appropriate data protection measures
- And comply with relevant privacy requirements

### Scenario: Secure Communication
- Given communication between system components
- When data is transmitted
- Then it should use encrypted channels
- And validate endpoint authenticity

### Scenario: Security Logging
- Given security-relevant events
- When the system detects them
- Then it should log appropriate details
- And generate alerts for suspicious activities

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Credential management requirements are defined
- [x] Access control model is documented
- [x] Data classification scheme is specified
- [x] Communication security requirements are established
- [x] Security logging guidelines are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story addresses the critical security aspects of the Clariad system. The implementation should follow security best practices for credential management, access control, data protection, and secure communication. Security-relevant events should be properly logged, and alerts should be generated for suspicious activities. The system must comply with relevant privacy and security requirements.
