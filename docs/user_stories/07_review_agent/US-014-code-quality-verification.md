# US-014: Code Quality Verification

**As a** quality assurance engineer,
**I want** the Review agent to thoroughly verify code quality
**So that** only high-quality code is merged into the main branch.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Acceptance Criteria Verification
- Given a pull request for a user story
- When the Review agent examines the code
- Then it should verify all acceptance criteria are properly implemented
- And confirm tests correctly validate each criterion

### Scenario: Code Style Analysis
- Given project code style guidelines
- When the Review agent reviews the code
- Then it should verify compliance with style guidelines
- And suggest improvements for any style violations

### Scenario: Test Coverage Assessment
- Given code with accompanying tests
- When the Review agent analyzes test coverage
- Then it should verify adequate test coverage for the implementation
- And identify any areas lacking sufficient tests

### Scenario: Code Complexity Analysis
- Given implemented code
- When the Review agent evaluates it
- Then it should assess code complexity and maintainability
- And recommend simplifications for overly complex sections

### Scenario: Security Review
- Given code that may have security implications
- When the Review agent examines it
- Then it should identify potential security issues
- And suggest appropriate mitigation strategies

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Code review criteria are defined
- [x] Style guideline documentation is available
- [x] Test coverage requirements are specified
- [x] Complexity assessment approach is documented
- [x] Security review guidelines are established

## Technical Notes

This user story follows the Test-First Implementation (US-012) in the workflow. The Review agent must retrieve the pull request from GitHub, analyze the code changes, and verify they meet quality standards and implement the user story's acceptance criteria. The agent should provide constructive feedback and either approve the PR or request changes.
