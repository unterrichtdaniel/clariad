## Technical Notes

This user story complements the Code Quality Verification (US-014) by focusing on how issues are communicated and managed. The Review agent must not only identify code quality issues but also provide feedback in a constructive manner that helps developers understand and address the problems. For minor issues, the agent should be able to implement fixes directly to streamline the development process.
