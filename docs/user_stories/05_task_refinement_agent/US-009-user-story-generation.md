# US-009: User Story Generation

**As a** project manager,  
**I want** the Task Refinement agent to generate well-formed user stories  
**So that** development tasks are clear, manageable, and aligned with project goals.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Feature Breakdown
- Given the Vision document with high-level features
- When the Task agent processes it
- Then it should break down each feature into appropriate user stories
- And ensure each story follows the format "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"

### Scenario: INVEST Compliance
- Given a draft user story
- When the Task agent reviews it
- Then it should verify the story meets all INVEST criteria
- And refine the story if any criteria are not met

### Scenario: User Story Scope Management
- Given a feature that would create an overly large user story
- When the Task agent breaks it down
- Then it should create multiple smaller, focused stories
- And ensure they collectively cover the entire feature scope

### Scenario: Story Priority Assignment
- Given multiple user stories
- When the Task agent analyzes their dependencies and business value
- Then it should assign appropriate priority levels
- And ensure high-priority stories are identified for early implementation

### Scenario: GitHub Issue Creation
- Given a finalized user story
- When the Task agent completes its validation
- Then it should create a corresponding GitHub issue
- And apply appropriate labels and metadata

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] User story format is defined
- [x] INVEST criteria application guidance is documented
- [x] Story sizing guidelines are established
- [x] Prioritization approach is specified
- [x] GitHub issue template is available

## Technical Notes

This user story follows the Architecture Document Generation (US-007) in the workflow. The Task Refinement agent must analyze both the Vision and Architecture documents to extract features and break them down into well-formed user stories. The agent should ensure each story is independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable (INVEST criteria).
