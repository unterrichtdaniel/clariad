# US-011: Definition of Ready Validation

**As a** development team member,  
**I want** the Task Refinement agent to validate that each story meets Definition of Ready  
**So that** development begins with clear, complete requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: DoR Checklist Verification
- Given a user story with acceptance criteria
- When the Task agent performs DoR validation
- Then it should check all items on the DoR checklist
- And flag any items that don't meet the criteria

### Scenario: Dependency Identification
- Given a user story may depend on other stories
- When the Task agent analyzes it
- Then it should identify and document all dependencies
- And ensure they are correctly reflected in GitHub issues

### Scenario: Story Sizing Validation
- Given a user story needs to be completable within one iteration
- When the Task agent reviews the scope
- Then it should verify the story is appropriately sized
- And suggest breaking it down further if too large

### Scenario: Technical Feasibility Check
- Given a user story includes technical requirements
- When the Task agent validates it
- Then it should verify alignment with the Architecture document
- And confirm technical feasibility based on architectural constraints

### Scenario: Automatic Refinement
- Given a story does not meet DoR criteria
- When the Task agent identifies the deficiencies
- Then it should automatically refine the story where possible
- And clearly document any areas requiring human input

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] DoR checklist is defined
- [x] Dependency tracking approach is documented
- [x] Story sizing guidelines are established
- [x] Technical feasibility verification process is specified
- [x] Refinement approach for deficient stories is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story complements the BDD Acceptance Criteria Creation (US-010) by ensuring that each user story meets the Definition of Ready criteria before being scheduled for development. The Task Refinement agent must validate various aspects of the story including clarity, scope, dependencies, and technical feasibility. Stories that don't meet the criteria should be automatically refined or flagged for human attention.
