# US-006: Vision Refinement Through Questioning

**As a** product manager,  
**I want** the Vision agent to ask clarifying questions when information is incomplete  
**So that** the resulting vision document is comprehensive and actionable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Incomplete Information Detection
- Given an initial project description with missing critical information
- When the Vision agent analyzes it
- Then it should identify the specific information gaps
- And formulate clear questions to address these gaps

### Scenario: User Question-Answer Processing
- Given the Vision agent has posed clarifying questions
- When the user provides answers
- Then the agent should incorporate this information into the vision document
- And update any related sections for consistency

### Scenario: Assumption Documentation
- Given some information remains unavailable even after questioning
- When the Vision agent must proceed with document creation
- Then it should explicitly document the assumptions it makes
- And highlight these as areas that may need future validation

### Scenario: Interactive Refinement
- Given an initial draft of the vision document
- When the user provides feedback on specific sections
- Then the agent should refine those sections based on feedback
- And ensure consistency across the entire document

### Scenario: Completion Verification
- Given all available information has been incorporated
- When the Vision document is finalized
- Then the agent should verify no critical information is missing
- And confirm the document meets Definition of Ready criteria

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Information gap identification strategy is defined
- [x] Question formulation guidance is documented
- [x] Assumption handling approach is specified
- [x] Feedback incorporation process is established
- [x] Completion verification checklist is created

## Technical Notes

This user story enhances the Vision Document Creation (US-005) by adding interactive capabilities. The Vision agent must be able to identify missing information, formulate clear questions, and incorporate user feedback. This requires maintaining conversation state and ensuring the vision document evolves appropriately based on new information.

## Related Architecture Elements

- Vision & Scope Agent component in the system architecture
- MCP Interface Layer for conversation management
- Semantic Memory System for storing and updating the vision document
