# US-019: Vision and Architecture Updates

**As a** project stakeholder,  
**I want** the Feedback agent to suggest updates to Vision and Architecture documents  
**So that** these documents evolve with the project and remain relevant.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Vision Document Review
- Given the current project state and feedback
- When the Feedback agent analyzes the Vision document
- Then it should identify outdated or missing elements
- And suggest specific updates to align with current understanding

### Scenario: Requirements Evolution Tracking
- Given changes in requirements during development
- When the Feedback agent reviews the project history
- Then it should document how requirements evolved
- And suggest Vision document updates to reflect these changes

### Scenario: Architecture Document Update Suggestions
- Given implemented architecture and identified drift
- When the Feedback agent analyzes architectural documents
- Then it should suggest specific updates to ADRs and the Architecture document
- And provide rationale for each suggested change

### Scenario: New ADR Creation
- Given significant architectural decisions made during development
- When the Feedback agent identifies undocumented decisions
- Then it should create draft ADRs for these decisions
- And link them to existing architectural documentation

### Scenario: Document Consistency Verification
- Given proposed updates to multiple documents
- When the Feedback agent finalizes recommendations
- Then it should verify consistency between all updated documents
- And ensure alignment between Vision, Architecture, and implementation

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Document update criteria are defined
- [x] Requirements evolution tracking approach is documented
- [x] Architecture update guidelines are specified
- [x] ADR creation process is documented
- [x] Document consistency verification approach is established

## Technical Notes

This user story complements the Retrospective Report Generation (US-018) by focusing specifically on maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the Vision and Architecture documents. The Feedback agent must analyze how the project has evolved, identify discrepancies between the original plans and the actual implementation, and suggest appropriate updates to keep the documentation aligned with reality.
