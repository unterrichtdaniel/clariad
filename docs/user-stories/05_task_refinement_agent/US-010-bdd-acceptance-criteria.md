# US-010: BDD Acceptance Criteria Creation

**As a** quality assurance engineer,
**I want** the Task Refinement agent to create BDD-style acceptance criteria for each user story
**So that** the development team has clear, testable requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Gherkin Scenario Creation
- Given a user story
- When the Task agent defines acceptance criteria
- Then it should create scenarios in Gherkin format (Given/When/Then)
- And each scenario should be clear, concise, and testable

### Scenario: Happy Path Coverage
- Given a user story's primary functionality
- When the Task agent creates acceptance criteria
- Then it should include scenarios covering the main successful path
- And ensure all core functionality is addressed

### Scenario: Edge Case Coverage
- Given a user story with potential edge cases
- When the Task agent creates acceptance criteria
- Then it should include scenarios for relevant edge cases
- And cover error handling and boundary conditions

### Scenario: Technical Requirement Incorporation
- Given architectural constraints or technical requirements
- When the Task agent creates acceptance criteria
- Then it should incorporate relevant technical details from the Architecture document
- And ensure scenarios align with architectural decisions

### Scenario: Verification Step Inclusion
- Given a scenario describing an action
- When the Task agent completes the scenario
- Then it should include appropriate verification steps
- And ensure the outcome is clearly defined and measurable

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Gherkin format guidelines are documented
- [x] Scenario coverage requirements are specified
- [x] Edge case identification approach is determined
- [x] Technical requirement sources are available
- [x] Verification step standards are established

## Technical Notes

This user story follows the User Story Generation (US-009) in the workflow. The Task Refinement agent must analyze each generated user story to identify the key scenarios that should be tested, including both happy paths and edge cases. These scenarios should be documented using the Gherkin format (Given/When/Then), which provides a clear template for both manual and automated testing.
