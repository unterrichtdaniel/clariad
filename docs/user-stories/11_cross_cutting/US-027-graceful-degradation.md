# US-027: Graceful Degradation

**As a** user,
**I want** the system to gracefully degrade when encountering problems
**So that** critical functionality remains available even under suboptimal conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: LLM API Limitations
- Given LLM API rate limits or availability issues
- When the system encounters these limitations
- Then it should implement appropriate throttling or queueing
- And continue operation with potentially increased latency

### Scenario: Partial Feature Availability
- Given a component failure affects some features
- When the system detects this condition
- Then it should disable affected features gracefully
- And continue providing unaffected functionality

### Scenario: Read-only Mode
- Given write operations to GitHub fail
- When the system detects persistent write failures
- Then it should enter a read-only mode
- And continue providing information and analysis capabilities

### Scenario: Caching for Resilience
- Given external service dependencies
- When the system experiences connectivity issues
- Then it should utilize cached data where appropriate
- And clearly indicate when using potentially stale information

### Scenario: User Communication
- Given degraded operational conditions
- When the system operates in a limited capacity
- Then it should clearly communicate limitations to users
- And provide estimates for resolution if available

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] System critical functions are identified
- [x] Degradation levels are documented
- [x] Caching strategy is specified
- [x] Feature dependency map is established
- [x] User communication templates are created

## Technical Notes

This user story builds on the Multi-layered Error Handling (US-026) by focusing specifically on maintaining system functionality during partial failures. The system should implement graceful degradation strategies such as throttling, feature disablement, read-only mode, and caching to ensure critical functionality remains available even when some components or dependencies are compromised.
