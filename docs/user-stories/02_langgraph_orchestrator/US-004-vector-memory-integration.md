# US-004: Vector Memory Integration

**As a** system developer,
**I want** to implement a semantic vector memory system
**So that** agents can store and retrieve contextual information efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Document Storage
- Given an agent produces a document
- When the document is passed to the memory system
- Then it should be embedded and stored with appropriate metadata
- And be retrievable via unique identifier

### Scenario: Semantic Search
- Given an agent needs relevant context for its task
- When it queries the vector memory with a semantic search
- Then it should receive the most contextually relevant documents
- And the search results should be ranked by relevance

### Scenario: Memory Persistence
- Given the system is restarted
- When an agent requests previously stored information
- Then the memory system should provide the requested data
- And maintain all associations and metadata

### Scenario: Context Filtering
- Given an agent needs specific types of information
- When it queries the vector memory with type filters
- Then it should receive only relevant documents of the requested types
- And the results should maintain their relevance ranking

### Scenario: Memory Updates
- Given a document in memory needs to be updated
- When an agent provides a new version
- Then the memory system should update the embedding and metadata
- And maintain version history of the document

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Vector database schema is defined
- [x] Embedding generation approach is selected
- [x] Query patterns are documented
- [x] Persistence requirements are specified
- [x] Update/versioning strategy is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story involves setting up a PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension to store embeddings of documents and agent outputs. The embedding model selection is critical for performance. This component will be used by all agents for context retrieval and storage, making it a foundational component of the system.
