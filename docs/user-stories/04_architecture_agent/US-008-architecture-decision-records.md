# US-008: Architecture Decision Records Creation

**As a** software architect,
**I want** the Architecture agent to create detailed Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**So that** important design decisions and their rationales are properly documented.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Key Decision Identification
- Given the Vision document and system requirements
- When the Architecture agent designs the system
- Then it should identify all key architectural decisions
- And create separate ADR documents for each significant decision

### Scenario: ADR Format Compliance
- Given a key architectural decision
- When the Architecture agent creates an ADR
- Then it should follow the standard ADR format
- And include title, status, context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences, and related decisions

### Scenario: Decision Rationale Documentation
- Given alternatives for an architectural decision
- When the Architecture agent selects an approach
- Then it should document clear rationale for the selection
- And explain why alternatives were not chosen

### Scenario: ADR Cross-Referencing
- Given multiple related ADRs
- When the Architecture agent creates or updates an ADR
- Then it should include cross-references to related decisions
- And ensure consistency between related ADRs

### Scenario: ADR Status Tracking
- Given an architectural decision may change over time
- When the Architecture agent creates an ADR
- Then it should clearly mark the decision status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, etc.)
- And update this status when appropriate

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] ADR template is defined
- [x] Decision identification guidance is documented
- [x] Required sections for ADRs are specified
- [x] Status tracking approach is established
- [x] Cross-referencing standards are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story complements the Architecture Document Generation (US-007) by focusing specifically on capturing and documenting key architectural decisions. The Architecture agent should identify decision points, evaluate alternatives, document rationale, and create well-structured ADRs. These ADRs should be stored in an appropriate directory (e.g., docs/architecture/) and cross-referenced with the main architecture document.

- Architecture Agent component in the system architecture
- Semantic Memory System for retrieving vision documents and storing ADRs
- GitHub Integration Layer for committing the ADR documents
- ADR format standards
