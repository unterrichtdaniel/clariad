# US-020: Documentation Management

**As a** project contributor,
**I want** the GitHub integration layer to manage documentation files effectively
**So that** all project documentation is properly versioned and accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Markdown File Creation
- Given documentation content from an agent
- When the GitHub integration creates a file
- Then it should format the content as Markdown
- And save it to the appropriate location in the docs/ directory

### Scenario: Documentation Organization
- Given different types of documentation
- When the GitHub integration stores them
- Then it should organize files into appropriate subdirectories
- And follow consistent naming conventions

### Scenario: Documentation Updates
- Given changes to existing documentation
- When the GitHub integration updates a file
- Then it should preserve file history
- And include clear commit messages explaining the changes

### Scenario: Documentation Linking
- Given related documentation files
- When the GitHub integration creates or updates them
- Then it should include appropriate cross-references
- And ensure links remain valid

### Scenario: File Conflict Resolution
- Given simultaneous updates to a documentation file
- When the GitHub integration detects a conflict
- Then it should implement an appropriate resolution strategy
- And preserve important content from both versions

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Documentation directory structure is defined
- [x] File naming conventions are documented
- [x] Update process guidelines are specified
- [x] Cross-reference standards are established
- [x] Conflict resolution approach is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story is a foundational component that supports all agents. The GitHub integration layer for documentation management must provide reliable APIs for creating, reading, updating, and organizing Markdown files in the repository. It needs to handle file conflicts gracefully and ensure documentation remains consistent and well-organized.
