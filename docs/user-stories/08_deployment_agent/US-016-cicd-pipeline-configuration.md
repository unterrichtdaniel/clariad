# US-016: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** the Deployment agent to configure and manage CI/CD pipelines
**So that** code can be continuously integrated, tested, and deployed.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Pipeline Configuration Creation
- Given a repository without CI/CD configuration
- When the Deployment agent analyzes the project
- Then it should create appropriate pipeline configuration files
- And customize them based on the project type and requirements

### Scenario: Build Process Configuration
- Given the project's technology stack
- When the Deployment agent sets up the build process
- Then it should configure appropriate build steps
- And ensure all dependencies are properly managed

### Scenario: Test Execution Configuration
- Given the project's test suite
- When the Deployment agent configures test execution
- Then it should ensure all tests run in the pipeline
- And configure appropriate test reporting

### Scenario: Deployment Stage Configuration
- Given the project's deployment requirements
- When the Deployment agent sets up deployment stages
- Then it should configure proper staging and production environments
- And implement appropriate deployment strategies

### Scenario: Secret Management
- Given the project requires secrets or credentials
- When the Deployment agent configures the pipeline
- Then it should implement secure secret management
- And avoid hardcoding sensitive information

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] CI/CD platform requirements are defined
- [x] Pipeline configuration templates are available
- [x] Build process documentation is available
- [x] Test execution requirements are specified
- [x] Deployment environment details are documented

## Technical Notes

This user story follows the Code Quality Verification (US-014) in the workflow. The Deployment agent must analyze the repository structure and technology stack to create appropriate CI/CD pipeline configurations. This typically involves creating GitHub Actions workflow files or similar configuration for other CI/CD platforms. The agent should implement best practices for build, test, and deployment processes.
