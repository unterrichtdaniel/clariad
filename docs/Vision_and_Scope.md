# Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem: Vision and Scope

## Project Vision

Clariad aims to empower software development teams with an intelligent AI-driven workflow assistant that integrates seamlessly into their existing processes, ensuring clarity, precision, and accelerated productivity across all stages of software creation. By embedding best practices directly into the development process through AI agents, Clariad creates a frictionless collaboration between human developers and specialized AI assistants.

## Key Features & Scope

1. **Comprehensive Multi-Agent Ecosystem** - A modular system of 7 specialized AI agents working in concert:
   - Vision & Scope Agent: Establishes project requirements and clear goals
   - Architecture Agent: Designs system architecture and documents key decisions
   - Task Refinement Agent: Breaks down work into well-defined user stories with BDD scenarios
   - Development Agent: Implements code using TDD principles
   - Review Agent: Ensures code quality and adherence to requirements
   - Deployment Agent: Manages CI/CD pipeline and deployment readiness
   - Feedback Agent: Analyzes results and provides retrospective analysis

2. **GitHub Integration** - Seamless interaction with version control:
   - Automatic creation and management of project documentation in Markdown format
   - Generation of GitHub issues for tasks, features, and improvements
   - Pull request management with intelligent code reviews
   - Commit management for code changes and documentation updates

3. **LangGraph Orchestration** - Robust workflow management:
   - State machine-based agent coordination ensuring proper sequencing
   - Shared memory context enabling knowledge transfer between agents
   - Conditional transitions and decision logic for complex workflows
   - Branching and looping capability for iterative development tasks

4. **MCP Protocol Support** - Conversational interaction:
   - Integration with Claude Desktop and OpenWebUI clients
   - Support for both autonomous execution and conversational collaboration
   - Natural language interface for development tasks and queries
   - Real-time feedback and progress updates

5. **Software Engineering Best Practices** - Built-in methodologies:
   - Agile development with proper user story formatting and prioritization
   - Behavior-Driven Development with Gherkin scenarios
   - Test-Driven Development workflow
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for design choices
   - Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) checkpoints

6. **Observability & Traceability** - Complete system visibility:
   - Langfuse integration for monitoring agent actions
   - Comprehensive logging of decision-making processes
   - Traceable actions across agent workflows
   - Analytics dashboards for system performance
git
7. **Extensible Infrastructure** - Adaptable architecture:
   - Modular design allowing individual agent updates without system breakage
   - Semantic memory for context retention across interactions
   - Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks
   - Ability to add specialized agents for specific tasks (e.g., security review)

## Out of Scope

The following aspects are explicitly excluded from the current scope:

1. **Direct Code Execution Environment** - Clariad does not provide a runtime environment for executing code. It integrates with existing CI/CD systems but does not replace them.

2. **UI/UX Design Generation** - While Clariad can document UI requirements and suggest implementation approaches, it does not generate visual designs or UI mockups.

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning** - Clariad documents deployment needs but does not directly provision cloud resources or infrastructure.

4. **Training Data Management** - The system does not include features for collecting, labeling, or managing training data for AI models.

5. **User Authentication/Authorization** - Clariad relies on GitHub's existing permissions and does not implement its own user management.

6. **Standalone IDE Integration** - The focus is on GitHub integration rather than direct IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.).

7. **Non-Software Projects** - Clariad is specifically designed for software development and may not be suitable for hardware, mechanical, or other non-software projects.

## Stakeholders & Users

### Primary Users
- **Software Developers** - Benefit from automated documentation, code generation, and quality assurance
- **Technical Project Managers** - Leverage improved requirements clarity and project tracking
- **Software Architects** - Gain assistance with design decisions and maintaining architectural integrity
- **QA Engineers** - Receive well-structured test cases and acceptance criteria

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Product Owners** - Benefit from improved requirement translation and documentation
- **DevOps Engineers** - Gain automated CI/CD configuration and deployment documentation
- **Technical Writers** - Leverage automatically generated documentation as a starting point
- **Business Analysts** - Benefit from better translation of business needs to technical requirements

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
1. **LLM Limitations** - Agents are constrained by the capabilities of underlying language models
2. **GitHub API Rate Limits** - System must operate within GitHub's API constraints
3. **Security Boundaries** - Agents must operate with appropriate permissions and security controls
4. **MCP Protocol Capabilities** - System must work within the constraints of the Model-Client Protocol

### Business Constraints
1. **Integration Requirements** - Must work with existing GitHub workflows without disruption
2. **Documentation Standards** - All outputs must follow agreed-upon formatting and quality guidelines
3. **Cost Management** - System must optimize LLM usage to control operational costs

### Assumptions
1. **GitHub as Primary Repository** - The system assumes GitHub is the project's primary code repository
2. **Markdown Documentation** - Documentation will be stored as Markdown files in the docs/ directory
3. **English Language** - Initial implementation assumes English language input and output
4. **Internet Connectivity** - System requires reliable internet access for API interactions
5. **Basic Project Structure** - Projects will follow standard organization patterns for their language/framework
