# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This guide explains how to use and configure the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for Clariad.

## Overview

Clariad uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD to automate building, testing, and deployment processes. The CI/CD pipeline ensures that code changes are built, tested, and deployed consistently and efficiently.

## Pipeline Structure

The Clariad CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Code Quality Checks**: Linting and static analysis
2. **Unit Tests**: Automated tests for individual components
3. **Integration Tests**: Tests for component interactions
4. **Build**: Packaging the application for deployment
5. **Deployment**: Deploying to the target environment
6. **Verification**: Post-deployment verification

## Workflow Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions workflow files located in the `.github/workflows` directory:

- `documentation.yml`: Documentation linting and validation
- `code-quality.yml`: Code linting and static analysis
- `unit-tests.yml`: Automated unit testing
- `integration-tests.yml`: Integration testing
- `build.yml`: Building the application
- `deploy.yml`: Deploying the application

## Setting Up CI/CD for Your Project

To set up the Clariad CI/CD pipeline for your project:

1. **Configure Repository**: Ensure your repository is set up properly
2. **Set Secrets**: Configure necessary secrets in your GitHub repository settings
3. **Customize Workflows**: Modify workflow files as needed for your project
4. **Enable Workflows**: Ensure workflows are enabled in your repository

## Deployment Environments

Clariad supports multiple deployment environments:

- **Development**: For active development and testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production testing
- **Production**: For live deployment

## CI/CD Best Practices

When working with the Clariad CI/CD pipeline, follow these best practices:

1. **Commit Small Changes**: Make small, focused commits to facilitate testing and rollback if needed
2. **Write Comprehensive Tests**: Ensure good test coverage for all code changes
3. **Monitor Workflow Runs**: Keep an eye on workflow runs to catch issues early
4. **Use Branch Protection**: Configure branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to main/master
5. **Use Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for code review and automated testing before merging

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Check Workflow Logs**: Review the detailed logs in GitHub Actions
2. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are correctly configured
3. **Test Locally**: Run tests locally to identify issues before pushing
4. **Validate Configuration**: Check workflow YAML files for syntax errors

## Customizing the Pipeline

You can customize the CI/CD pipeline for your specific needs:

1. **Add Custom Steps**: Add additional steps to workflow files as needed
2. **Modify Environment Variables**: Adjust environment variables used in workflows
3. **Change Deployment Targets**: Configure different deployment targets
4. **Add Notifications**: Set up notifications for workflow success/failure

## Example: Workflow File

Here's an example of a GitHub Actions workflow file for running unit tests:

```yaml
name: Unit Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements-dev.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements-dev.txt; fi
        pip install pytest pytest-cov

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=xml

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
```
