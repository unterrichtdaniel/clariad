# GitHub Integration Guide

This guide explains how Clariad integrates with GitHub and how to set up and use this integration.

## Overview

Clariad is deeply integrated with GitHub to provide seamless version control, documentation management, issue tracking, and code review capabilities. This integration enables Clariad agents to create and manage project artifacts directly in your GitHub repository.

## Integration Capabilities

Clariad's GitHub integration provides the following capabilities:

1. **Documentation Management**
   - Create and update Markdown documentation
   - Organize documentation in repository directories
   - Track documentation changes with proper commit messages

2. **Code Management**
   - Create and update code files
   - Create branches for features and bug fixes
   - Commit code changes with descriptive messages

3. **Issue Tracking**
   - Create and update GitHub issues
   - Link issues to user stories and features
   - Assign labels, milestones, and assignees

4. **Pull Request Management**
   - Create pull requests for code changes
   - Include detailed descriptions and links to issues
   - Request and manage reviews

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflows
   - Monitor and report on CI/CD status
   - Use automated testing and deployment

## Setup Instructions

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup

Your GitHub repository should be structured with the following key directories:

- `/docs` - For all project documentation
- `/src` - For source code
- `/tests` - For automated tests
- `/.github/workflows` - For GitHub Actions workflows

### 2. Authentication Configuration

Clariad uses a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication:

1. Create a PAT in your GitHub account settings
2. Ensure the token has the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of repositories)
   - `workflow` (For GitHub Actions workflows)
3. Store the token in your Clariad configuration

### 3. Repository Configuration

Configure Clariad with your repository details:

```
repository_owner: your-username-or-org
repository_name: your-repository
branch: main  # Default branch
```

## Using GitHub Integration

### Documentation Workflow

When creating or updating documentation:

1. Clariad agents will create or update Markdown files in the `/docs` directory
2. Changes are committed with descriptive messages
3. For significant documentation updates, pull requests may be created

### Code Development Workflow

When developing code:

1. A feature branch is created (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
2. Tests are written first (following TDD principles)
3. Implementation code is added to pass the tests
4. A pull request is created for review
5. After review and approval, the branch is merged

### Issue Management

For managing issues:

1. User stories are created as GitHub issues
2. Issues are labeled for categorization (e.g., `feature`, `bug`, `documentation`)
3. Issues are assigned to milestones for planning
4. Progress is tracked through issue status

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Branch Names**: Follow a consistent naming convention for branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`)

2. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the change

3. **Link Issues and Pull Requests**: Reference issues in pull requests and commits using the `#issue-number` syntax

4. **Follow GitHub Flow**: Use a simplified workflow based on feature branches and pull requests

5. **Use Pull Request Templates**: Configure templates for consistent pull request descriptions

6. **Implement Code Reviews**: Require at least one approval on pull requests before merging

## Permissions and Security

Ensure that GitHub permissions are properly configured:

1. **Repository Access**: Grant appropriate access to team members
2. **Branch Protection**: Configure branch protection rules for main/master branches
3. **Required Reviews**: Require pull request reviews before merging
4. **Status Checks**: Require status checks to pass before merging

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with GitHub integration:

1. **Authentication Issues**: Verify your token has the correct permissions
2. **Rate Limiting**: Check if you're hitting GitHub API rate limits
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the operations
4. **Network Issues**: Verify network connectivity to GitHub
