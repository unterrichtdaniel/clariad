# ADR-004: MCP Protocol Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem needs to provide a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the system through familiar clients. The Model-Client Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a standard for LLM-based applications, supported by clients like Claude Desktop and OpenWebUI.

## Decision

We will implement an MCP protocol server as the primary interface for user interaction with the Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem, enabling seamless integration with MCP-compatible clients.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Web UI**: Building a proprietary web interface for the system.
   - Pros: Complete control over UX, tailored to specific workflow needs.
   - Cons: Development effort, maintenance burden, limited client options for users.

2. **REST API Only**: Exposing functionality only through a REST API.
   - Pros: Standard interface, client-agnostic.
   - Cons: Poor support for streaming responses, less conversational, more complex integration.

3. **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for developer-focused interaction.
   - Pros: Simplicity, scriptability, familiar to developers.
   - Cons: Limited accessibility, poor UX for non-technical users, no streaming.

## Decision Drivers

1. **User Experience**: Need for a natural, conversational interface.
2. **Client Flexibility**: Allowing users to choose their preferred interface.
3. **Streaming Support**: Requirement for streaming agent responses in real-time.
4. **Standards Adoption**: Following emerging standards in the LLM application space.
5. **Tool Integration**: Support for complex tool usage patterns by agents.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enables users to access Clariad through familiar interfaces like Claude Desktop
- Provides a conversational experience with real-time streaming responses
- Simplifies integration with existing LLM workflows
- Follows emerging standards in the AI assistant ecosystem
- Handles complex multi-agent interactions behind a unified interface

### Negative

- Reliance on a relatively new protocol that may evolve
- Additional complexity in handling protocol-specific requirements
- Possible limitations in protocol capabilities for specialized interactions
- Need for protocol-compliant error handling and message formatting

## Implementation Notes

- Implement an MCP-compatible server that exposes the agent ecosystem
- Support streaming responses from agents to clients
- Handle proper formatting of tool usage and specialized content
- Route user requests to the appropriate agent via the orchestrator
- Maintain conversation state for multi-turn interactions
- Support both autonomous and interactive operation modes
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery within protocol constraints
