# ADR-004: MCP Protocol Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem needs to provide a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the system through familiar clients. The Model-Client Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a standard for LLM-based applications, supported by clients like Claude Desktop. We need to determine how to best integrate with this protocol.

## Decision

We will implement Clariad as an MCP extension for Claude Desktop, registering specialized agents as tools that Claude can invoke during conversations. This will allow Clariad to leverage Claude Desktop's existing LLM connection while providing specialized software development capabilities.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Web UI**: Building a proprietary web interface for the system.
   - Pros: Complete control over UX, tailored to specific workflow needs.
   - Cons: Development effort, maintenance burden, limited client options for users.

2. **REST API Only**: Exposing functionality only through a REST API.
   - Pros: Standard interface, client-agnostic.
   - Cons: Poor support for streaming responses, less conversational, more complex integration.

3. **Standalone MCP Client**: Building a complete MCP client with its own LLM connection.
   - Pros: Full control over the entire system, independence from Claude Desktop.
   - Cons: Requires LLM API keys, additional costs, duplicates existing functionality.

## Decision Drivers

1. **User Experience**: Need for a natural, conversational interface.
2. **Efficient LLM Usage**: Leverage existing Claude Desktop LLM connection rather than establishing new ones.
3. **Integration Simplicity**: Follow the established pattern of successful MCP extensions.
4. **Standards Adoption**: Following emerging standards in the LLM application space.
5. **Tool Integration**: Support for complex tool usage patterns by agents.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enables users to access Clariad through the familiar Claude Desktop interface
- Leverages existing Claude Desktop LLM connection without additional API costs
- Provides a conversational experience with real-time streaming responses
- Follows emerging standards for AI assistant extensions
- True extension model rather than a parallel system

### Negative

- Dependency on Claude Desktop's capabilities and limitations
- Limited control over the LLM interaction (compared to direct API access)
- Possible constraints on parallelization of agent operations
- Need for efficient context management within Claude's context window

## Implementation Notes

- Implement Clariad as an MCP server that registers with Claude Desktop via the claude_desktop_config.json file
- Register specialized agents as tools that Claude can invoke when needed
- Use standard input/output (stdio) for communication with Claude Desktop
- Design the system to handle tool invocation requests from Claude
- Implement efficient context management to work within Claude's context window
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery within protocol constraints
