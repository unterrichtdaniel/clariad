# ADR-002: LangGraph as Orchestration Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem requires a robust orchestration framework to coordinate multiple specialized agents throughout the software development lifecycle. We need a system that can manage agent transitions, state persistence, and complex workflows.

## Decision

We will use LangGraph as the primary orchestration framework for the Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Orchestration System**: Building a proprietary orchestration layer from scratch.
   - Pros: Complete control, tailored to specific needs.
   - Cons: Significant development effort, maintenance burden, reinventing the wheel.

2. **LangChain without LangGraph**: Using just LangChain's agent capabilities without the graph structure.
   - Pros: Simplified architecture, fewer dependencies.
   - Cons: Less structured agent interactions, limited workflow control.

3. **Workflow Engine (e.g., Airflow, Temporal)**: Using an existing workflow orchestration system.
   - Pros: Mature tooling, robust scheduling.
   - Cons: Not optimized for LLM agent interactions, additional complexity.

## Decision Drivers

1. **State Management**: Need for robust state persistence across agent invocations.
2. **Transition Logic**: Requirement for conditional branching and complex workflows.
3. **Integration**: Compatibility with LangChain for agent implementation.
4. **Community Support**: Established framework with ongoing development.
5. **Complexity Management**: Ability to model SDLC as a directed graph.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Natural mapping of software development workflow to graph nodes and edges
- Built-in state management for sharing context between agents
- Conditional transitions for handling complex development paths
- Structured approach to agent communication
- Growing ecosystem and community support
- Integration with LangChain's agent framework and tools

### Negative

- Dependency on relatively new technology
- Potential learning curve for team members
- May require custom extensions for specific needs
- Limited control compared to a fully custom solution

## Implementation Notes

- Each agent will be implemented as a node in the LangGraph
- State will be persisted in a shared database accessible to all agents
- Transitions will follow the standard software development lifecycle
- We'll implement conditional logic for cases like failed reviews or regression testing
- The Feedback Agent will have a transition back to the Vision Agent to enable continuous improvement
