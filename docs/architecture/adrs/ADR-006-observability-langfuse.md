# ADR-006: Observability with Langfuse

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem requires comprehensive observability to monitor agent behavior, track performance, debug issues, and ensure reliable operation. With multiple AI agents working together, understanding the system's internal state and decision processes is critical.

## Decision

We will implement an observability framework using Langfuse as the primary tracing and monitoring solution for all agent interactions.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **General-Purpose Observability Tools**: Using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, wider adoption, extensive features.
   - Cons: Not optimized for LLM applications, requires custom instrumentation.

2. **Custom Logging Solution**: Building a proprietary logging and monitoring system.
   - Pros: Tailored to exact needs, complete control.
   - Cons: Development effort, maintenance burden, limited features.

3. **OpenTelemetry with Custom Backend**: Using OpenTelemetry for instrumentation with custom analysis.
   - Pros: Standardized instrumentation, flexibility.
   - Cons: Complex setup, requires backend development, less LLM-specific.

## Decision Drivers

1. **LLM Specialization**: Need for tools designed specifically for LLM application monitoring.
2. **Trace Completeness**: Requirement to capture full agent conversations, prompts, and responses.
3. **Integration**: Easy integration with LangChain and LangGraph ecosystem.
4. **Analysis Capabilities**: Tools for analyzing agent performance and behavior.
5. **Setup Complexity**: Ease of implementation and maintenance.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Specialized observability for LLM agents and their interactions
- Complete tracing of prompts, responses, and tool usage
- Easy integration with LangChain via callbacks
- Purpose-built dashboards and analytics for LLM applications
- Ability to identify and debug issues across the agent workflow
- Performance metrics to guide optimization efforts

### Negative

- Dependency on a specific vendor's platform
- Potential costs associated with hosted service
- Learning curve for a specialized tool
- May require additional instrumentation for custom components
- Could become a bottleneck if not properly configured

## Implementation Notes

- Implement Langfuse tracing for all agent interactions via LangChain callbacks
- Configure trace hierarchies to represent the agent workflow graph
- Define key metrics for monitoring (latency, token usage, success rates)
- Set up alerting for critical errors or performance degradation
- Structure traces to capture context between agent handoffs
- Implement trace sampling for high-volume production environments
- Use unique trace IDs to correlate user sessions with agent actions
