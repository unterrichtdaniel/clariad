# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem.

## What Are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes a choice the team has made regarding the system architecture.

3. [ADR-003: Semantic Memory](adr-003-semantic-memory.md)
4. [ADR-004: MCP Protocol](adr-004-mcp-protocol.md)
5. [ADR-005: GitHub Integration](adr-005-github-integration.md)
6. [ADR-006: Observability with Langfuse](adr-006-observability-langfuse.md)
7. [ADR-007: Python Language](adr-007-python-language.md)
8. [ADR-008: Error Handling](adr-008-error-handling.md)
9. [ADR-009: Agent Prompt Design](adr-009-agent-prompt-design.md)
10. [ADR-010: Markdown Documentation](adr-010-markdown-documentation.md)
11. [ADR-011: Claude Desktop LLM Integration](adr-011-claude-desktop-llm-integration.md)

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Title**: A descriptive title that includes the ADR number
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: Background information and problem description
- **Decision**: The decision that was made
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered
- **Decision Drivers**: The factors that influenced the decision
- **Consequences**: The results of the decision, both positive and negative
- **Implementation Notes**: Guidance for implementing the decision
- **Related Decisions**: Links to related ADRs

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new ADR, use the following process:

1. Create a new file named `adr-XXX-short-title.md` where XXX is the next available number
2. Follow the established ADR format
3. Submit the ADR for team review
4. Update the status based on the outcome of the review
