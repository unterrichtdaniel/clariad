# ADR-008: Error Handling Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem requires a robust error handling strategy to manage failures at various levels: LLM API issues, agent processing errors, tool execution failures, and integration problems. A systematic approach to error handling is essential for reliability and user experience.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered error handling strategy that combines graceful degradation, comprehensive logging, user feedback, and recovery mechanisms.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Fail Fast Approach**: Immediately stopping execution when errors occur.
   - Pros: Simplicity, clear error boundaries.
   - Cons: Poor user experience, lack of resilience, limited recovery options.

2. **Silent Recovery**: Attempting to hide errors from users.
   - Pros: Smoother user experience for minor issues.
   - Cons: Potential for inconsistent state, hidden issues, debugging difficulty.

3. **Manual Case-by-Case Handling**: Ad-hoc error handling without a systematic approach.
   - Pros: Flexibility, minimal upfront design.
   - Cons: Inconsistency, gaps in coverage, maintenance burden.

## Decision Drivers

1. **User Experience**: Maintaining a positive user experience despite errors.
2. **Recoverability**: Ability to continue operation when possible.
3. **Transparency**: Appropriate visibility of errors for users and developers.
4. **Debugging**: Ease of diagnosing and fixing issues.
5. **System Integrity**: Maintaining consistent system state even during failures.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved system reliability and uptime
- Better user experience through graceful error handling
- Comprehensive error information for debugging
- Consistent approach across the codebase
- Ability to recover from transient failures
- Clear visibility into system health and issues

### Negative

- Increased development complexity for error handling
- Additional code and logic to maintain
- Potential for masking serious issues with recovery mechanisms
- Need for extensive testing of error scenarios
- Risk of inconsistent state if recovery isn't properly implemented

## Implementation Notes

### Error Classification

We will classify errors into the following categories:

1. **Fatal Errors**: Unrecoverable errors that require system restart or human intervention.
2. **Recoverable Errors**: Errors where alternative paths or retry strategies can succeed.
3. **Degraded Operation Errors**: Errors that limit functionality but don't prevent core operation.
4. **Warning Conditions**: Issues that should be logged but don't affect operation.

### Error Handling Layers

1. **Global Error Handling**:
   - Top-level error boundaries in the orchestrator
   - Fallback mechanisms for critical failures
   - Session persistence to prevent complete work loss

2. **Agent-Level Error Handling**:
   - Each agent has specialized error handling for its domain
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation options when full functionality is unavailable

3. **Integration Error Handling**:
   - Robust handling of external service failures (GitHub, LLM APIs)
   - Caching and fallback strategies for integration points
   - Rate limiting and backoff strategies

4. **User Communication**:
   - Clear, actionable error messages for users
   - Appropriate exposure of technical details based on context
   - Suggested remediation steps where applicable

### Monitoring and Alerting

- All errors captured in Langfuse traces
- Critical errors trigger alerts for immediate attention
- Error patterns analyzed for systematic improvements
