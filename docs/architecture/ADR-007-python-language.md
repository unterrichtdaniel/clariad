# ADR-007: Python as Implementation Language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem requires a primary implementation language for its components. This decision impacts development speed, ecosystem compatibility, maintainability, and performance.

## Decision

We will use Python as the primary implementation language for the Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Using Node.js ecosystem.
   - Pros: Strong async capabilities, type safety with TypeScript, wide adoption.
   - Cons: Less mature LLM tooling, weaker data science ecosystem.

2. **Go**: Using a compiled language for performance.
   - Pros: Performance, type safety, concurrency, small deployment footprint.
   - Cons: Less mature LLM libraries, more verbose, slower development cycle.

3. **Polyglot Approach**: Different components in different languages.
   - Pros: Best tool for each job, specialized performance.
   - Cons: Integration complexity, knowledge fragmentation, maintenance burden.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Alignment with LangChain, LangGraph, and AI tooling.
2. **Development Speed**: Ability to iterate quickly on features.
3. **Team Familiarity**: Existing team knowledge and comfort.
4. **Library Support**: Availability of libraries for AI, vector operations, etc.
5. **Community**: Size and activity of the community for support.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Perfect alignment with LangChain, LangGraph, and other key AI libraries
- Rich ecosystem for AI, ML, and NLP tasks
- Rapid development and iteration cycles
- Strong community support and extensive documentation
- Excellent vector operation libraries (numpy, scipy) for semantic embeddings
- Good integration with most LLM APIs and vector databases
- Type hints available for improved code quality without strict typing

### Negative

- Performance limitations compared to compiled languages
- GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) constraints for certain parallel operations
- Runtime errors that could be caught at compile time in other languages
- Deployment complexity (dependencies, environment management)
- Potential scaling limitations for extremely high-throughput requirements

## Implementation Notes

- Use Python 3.10+ for modern language features
- Implement type hints throughout the codebase for better maintainability
- Use async features (asyncio) for I/O-bound operations like API calls
- Consider performance-critical components carefully, with optional optimization
- Structure the project following Python best practices (src layout, pyproject.toml)
- Use virtual environments and dependency management (Poetry or Pip with requirements.txt)
- Implement comprehensive tests with pytest
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines with appropriate tooling (black, isort, flake8)
