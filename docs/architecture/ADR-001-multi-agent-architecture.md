# ADR-001: Multi-Agent System Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem needs a robust architecture to support AI-driven workflow assistance across all stages of software development. We need to determine whether to use a monolithic design with a single large agent handling all responsibilities or a multi-agent approach with specialized components.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-agent architecture using LangGraph for orchestration, with distinct specialized agents for each phase of the software development lifecycle.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Monolithic Agent**: One large agent with comprehensive prompting for all stages of software development.
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, consistent "voice", shared context.
   - Cons: Complex prompting, harder to maintain, limited specialization, prone to confusion between roles.

2. **Multi-Agent System with Custom Orchestration**: Multiple agents with a custom-built orchestration layer.
   - Pros: Full control over orchestration, specialized agents.
   - Cons: Requires building and maintaining custom orchestration logic.

3. **Serverless Functions per Agent**: Each agent implemented as separate serverless functions.
   - Pros: Simple scaling, clear separation of concerns.
   - Cons: More complex state management, potential cold start issues.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each development phase requires different expertise and focus.
2. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused agents are easier to update and improve.
3. **Specialization**: Different phases benefit from specifically tailored prompts and tools.
4. **Workflow Management**: Software development follows a graph-like progression with decision points.
5. **Industry Trends**: Multi-agent systems are showing promising results for complex tasks.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear responsibilities for each agent aligned with specific development phases
- Improved maintainability as each agent can be updated independently
- Better specialized expertise for each development task
- Flexible workflow with conditional transitions and loops
- Easier to insert new agent types (e.g., security review) without disrupting the system

### Negative

- Increased system complexity with multiple components
- Potential challenges in context sharing between agents
- Need for robust orchestration and state management
- Possible inconsistencies in agent outputs or styles

## Implementation Notes

- Each agent will be implemented as a node in a LangGraph state machine
- Shared memory (PostgreSQL with pgvector) will enable context persistence
- The orchestrator will manage transitions between agents
- Each agent will have a specialized prompt optimized for its specific role
