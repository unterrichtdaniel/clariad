# US-022: Issue Tracking Integration

**As a** project manager,
**I want** the GitHub integration layer to effectively manage issues and tracking
**So that** tasks and progress are visible and properly documented.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Issue Creation from User Stories
- Given a user story from the Task Refinement agent
- When the GitHub integration creates an issue
- Then it should format the issue correctly using the User Story template
- And apply appropriate labels and metadata

### Scenario: Issue Updates
- Given changes to a user story or task
- When the GitHub integration updates the issue
- Then it should preserve the update history
- And notify relevant stakeholders

### Scenario: Issue Status Tracking
- Given progress on a task
- When the GitHub integration updates status
- Then it should move the issue through appropriate workflow states
- And update relevant labels and assignees

### Scenario: Issue Linking
- Given related issues
- When the GitHub integration creates or updates them
- Then it should establish appropriate relationships (dependencies, subtasks)
- And ensure these relationships are visible

### Scenario: Issue Search and Filtering
- Given the need to retrieve specific issues
- When the GitHub integration searches for issues
- Then it should apply appropriate filters
- And return relevant results efficiently

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Issue template requirements are defined
- [x] Issue labeling scheme is documented
- [x] Status workflow states are specified
- [x] Issue relationship types are established
- [x] Search and filtering requirements are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story complements the Documentation Management (US-020) and Code Repository Management (US-021) by focusing on issue tracking aspects of the GitHub integration. The integration layer must provide reliable APIs for creating, updating, and managing issues that represent user stories, tasks, bugs, and other work items. It should support proper labeling, workflow state management, and relationship tracking to ensure visibility and traceability.
