# US-025: Logging and Debugging Support

**As a** developer,
**I want** the Observability Framework to provide comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
**So that** issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Log Level Configuration
- Given different operational environments
- When the Observability Framework configures logging
- Then it should apply appropriate log levels per environment
- And ensure sensitive information is properly handled

### Scenario: Structured Logging
- Given system events that need logging
- When the Observability Framework logs them
- Then it should use structured log formats
- And include contextual metadata for each event

### Scenario: Log Aggregation
- Given logs generated across multiple components
- When the Observability Framework collects them
- Then it should aggregate logs centrally
- And preserve relationships between related log entries

### Scenario: Debug Mode Activation
- Given a need for detailed troubleshooting
- When the Observability Framework enables debug mode
- Then it should capture additional diagnostic information
- And provide enhanced visibility into system operations

### Scenario: Log Retention and Search
- Given regulatory and operational requirements
- When the Observability Framework manages logs
- Then it should implement appropriate retention policies
- And provide efficient search capabilities

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Log level standards are defined
- [x] Structured log format is documented
- [x] Aggregation requirements are specified
- [x] Debug mode capabilities are established
- [x] Retention and search requirements are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story complements the Performance Monitoring (US-024) and Langfuse Tracing Integration (US-023) by providing comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities. The system should use structured logging formats with appropriate metadata to enable efficient troubleshooting. Different log levels should be configurable per environment, and a debug mode should be available for detailed diagnostics when needed.
