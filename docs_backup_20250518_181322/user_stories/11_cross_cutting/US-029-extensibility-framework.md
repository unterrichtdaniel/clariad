# US-029: Extensibility Framework

**As a** system developer,
**I want** the system to provide an extensibility framework
**So that** new agents or capabilities can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: New Agent Integration
- Given a need for a new specialized agent
- When developers create the agent
- Then it should integrate seamlessly with the orchestrator
- And receive appropriate context from other agents

### Scenario: Tool Integration
- Given requirements for new tool integrations
- When developers implement these integrations
- Then the system should support them through a standard interface
- And make them available to appropriate agents

### Scenario: Prompt Template Extension
- Given new prompt templates or strategies
- When developers create them
- Then the system should incorporate them into the prompt management framework
- And allow agents to utilize them appropriately

### Scenario: LLM Provider Switching
- Given a need to use alternative LLM providers
- When the system is configured for a new provider
- Then it should adapt all prompts and interactions accordingly
- And maintain functionality across the transition

### Scenario: Workflow Customization
- Given unique project requirements for workflow
- When administrators configure the system
- Then it should support custom workflow definitions
- And execute them correctly through the orchestrator

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Agent interface standards are defined
- [x] Tool integration framework is documented
- [x] Prompt template system is specified
- [x] LLM abstraction layer requirements are established
- [x] Workflow definition format is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story addresses the extensibility requirements of the Clariad system. The implementation should provide clean interfaces for adding new agents, tools, prompt templates, and LLM providers. The architecture should support workflow customization to adapt to different project needs. Extensibility points should be well-documented and follow consistent patterns to facilitate future enhancements.
