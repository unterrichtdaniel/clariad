# US-023: Langfuse Tracing Integration

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** the Observability Framework to integrate with Langfuse for comprehensive tracing
**So that** all agent actions are visible and analyzable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Agent Action Tracing
- Given an agent performing an action
- When the Observability Framework logs the action
- Then it should create a Langfuse trace with appropriate metadata
- And capture all relevant context

### Scenario: LLM Call Tracking
- Given an agent making an LLM API call
- When the Observability Framework monitors the call
- Then it should record the prompt, response, and performance metrics
- And associate them with the correct trace

### Scenario: Tool Usage Monitoring
- Given an agent using integrated tools (GitHub, etc.)
- When the Observability Framework tracks tool usage
- Then it should record inputs, outputs, and performance
- And link them to the correct trace

### Scenario: Trace Hierarchy Creation
- Given a complex workflow with multiple agents
- When the Observability Framework traces the process
- Then it should create a hierarchical trace structure
- And show the relationships between agent actions

### Scenario: Error State Capture
- Given an error occurs during agent execution
- When the Observability Framework detects it
- Then it should capture detailed error information
- And maintain the complete trace context

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Langfuse integration requirements are defined
- [x] Trace structure standards are documented
- [x] LLM call tracking specifications are established
- [x] Tool monitoring requirements are specified
- [x] Error capture process is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story is a foundational component of the system's observability capabilities. The integration with Langfuse will provide comprehensive tracing of all agent actions, LLM calls, and tool usage. This is essential for debugging, performance optimization, and understanding the system's behavior. The implementation should use the LangChain callback mechanism to integrate with Langfuse.
