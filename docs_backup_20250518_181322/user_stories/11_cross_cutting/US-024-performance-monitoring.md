# US-024: Performance Monitoring

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** the Observability Framework to monitor and report on system performance
**So that** bottlenecks can be identified and addressed.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Response Time Tracking
- Given agent operations with performance requirements
- When the Observability Framework monitors execution
- Then it should record response times for each operation
- And compare them against established baselines

### Scenario: Resource Usage Monitoring
- Given system resources allocated to the Clariad ecosystem
- When the Observability Framework monitors resource usage
- Then it should track CPU, memory, and API call volumes
- And identify potential resource constraints

### Scenario: Throughput Measurement
- Given concurrent operations in the system
- When the Observability Framework measures throughput
- Then it should record operations per unit time
- And highlight capacity limitations

### Scenario: Performance Alert Generation
- Given performance thresholds for critical operations
- When the Observability Framework detects threshold violations
- Then it should generate appropriate alerts
- And include relevant context for investigation

### Scenario: Performance Trend Analysis
- Given historical performance data
- When the Observability Framework analyzes trends
- Then it should identify patterns and anomalies
- And generate insights for optimization

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Performance metric definitions are established
- [x] Baseline performance expectations are documented
- [x] Resource monitoring requirements are specified
- [x] Alert threshold criteria are defined
- [x] Trend analysis approach is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story complements the Langfuse Tracing Integration (US-023) by focusing specifically on performance aspects of the observability framework. The system must track response times, resource usage, and throughput to identify bottlenecks and performance issues. Historical data should be analyzed to identify trends and anomalies, and alerts should be generated when thresholds are exceeded.
