# US-030: Documentation and Self-documentation

**As a** project contributor,
**I want** the system to maintain comprehensive documentation about itself
**So that** the architecture, functionality, and usage are clear to all stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Architecture Documentation Maintenance
- Given system architectural changes
- When the Feedback agent detects them
- Then it should update architecture documentation
- And ensure diagrams and descriptions remain accurate

### Scenario: Agent Capability Documentation
- Given agent functionality and capabilities
- When the system generates documentation
- Then it should clearly describe each agent's role and capabilities
- And provide examples of their outputs

### Scenario: API and Integration Documentation
- Given system APIs and integration points
- When the system generates documentation
- Then it should provide comprehensive interface specifications
- And include usage examples and best practices

### Scenario: User Guide Creation
- Given system functionality for end users
- When the system generates user documentation
- Then it should create clear, task-oriented guidance
- And include appropriate screenshots or diagrams

### Scenario: Documentation Versioning
- Given documentation changes over time
- When the system updates documentation
- Then it should maintain appropriate version history
- And highlight significant changes between versions

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Documentation standards are defined
- [x] Self-documentation requirements are specified
- [x] User guide template is established
- [x] API documentation format is determined
- [x] Version tracking approach is documented

## Technical Notes

This user story addresses the documentation needs of the Clariad system, including the ability to generate and maintain documentation about itself. The implementation should support updating architecture documentation when changes are detected, documenting agent capabilities and APIs, creating user guides, and tracking documentation versions. This self-documentation capability ensures that the system's documentation remains accurate and useful over time.
