# US-005: Vision Document Creation

**As a** product manager,
**I want** the Vision & Scope agent to create comprehensive project vision documents
**So that** all team members have a clear understanding of the project goals and requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Vision Creation from Initial Description
- Given a brief project description
- When the Vision agent processes it
- Then it should generate a complete Vision & Scope document
- And the document should include all required sections: Project Vision, Key Features & Scope, Out of Scope, Stakeholders & Users, Constraints & Assumptions, Success Metrics

### Scenario: Stakeholder Identification
- Given project requirements information
- When the Vision agent analyzes user needs
- Then it should identify all relevant stakeholders and user types
- And categorize them appropriately in the document

### Scenario: Feature Extraction
- Given a project description with implied features
- When the Vision agent processes it
- Then it should extract and explicitly list all key features
- And ensure they follow INVEST-like criteria for clarity and value

### Scenario: Success Metrics Definition
- Given the project goals
- When the Vision agent defines success metrics
- Then each metric should be specific, measurable, and relevant to project goals
- And include target values where appropriate

### Scenario: Definition of Ready Verification
- Given the generated Vision document
- When the agent completes its task
- Then it should verify the document meets all Definition of Ready criteria
- And highlight any areas that need clarification

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Vision document template is defined
- [x] Required sections are specified
- [x] DoR criteria for vision documents are established
- [x] Feature extraction guidance is documented
- [x] Stakeholder categorization approach is determined

## Technical Notes

This user story is the first in the agent workflow sequence. The Vision agent will need to use LLM capabilities to analyze project descriptions, identify key elements, and structure them into a comprehensive document. The output will be stored in the semantic memory and as a Markdown file in the docs/ directory of the GitHub repository.

## Related Architecture Elements

- Vision & Scope Agent component in the system architecture
- Semantic Memory System for storing the vision document
- GitHub Integration Layer for committing the document
