# US-012: Test-First Implementation

**As a** software developer,
**I want** the Development agent to implement code using TDD principles
**So that** the code is thoroughly tested and meets requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Test Creation from Acceptance Criteria
- Given a user story with BDD acceptance criteria
- When the Development agent begins implementation
- Then it should first translate each scenario into appropriate test code
- And ensure tests initially fail (proving they test something meaningful)

### Scenario: Minimal Implementation
- Given failing tests
- When the Development agent writes implementation code
- Then it should write the minimal code needed to make tests pass
- And follow the architectural guidelines from the Architecture document

### Scenario: Refactoring After Tests Pass
- Given the implementation passes all tests
- When the Development agent reviews the code
- Then it should refactor for clarity, performance, and maintainability
- And ensure tests continue to pass after refactoring

### Scenario: Edge Case Test Coverage
- Given the happy path is implemented
- When the Development agent continues implementation
- Then it should add tests for edge cases and error conditions
- And implement code to handle these scenarios correctly

### Scenario: Documentation Generation
- Given the implementation is complete
- When the Development agent finalizes the code
- Then it should add appropriate documentation (comments, docstrings)
- And update any required user-facing documentation

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Testing framework standards are defined
- [x] Test organization guidelines are documented
- [x] Code implementation approach is specified
- [x] Refactoring criteria are established
- [x] Documentation requirements are determined

## Technical Notes

This user story follows the BDD Acceptance Criteria Creation (US-010) in the workflow. The Development agent must retrieve the user story and its acceptance criteria from semantic memory or GitHub issues, and implement code following Test-Driven Development principles. This involves writing tests first, implementing just enough code to make tests pass, and then refactoring while maintaining passing tests.

## Related Architecture Elements

- Development Agent component in the system architecture
- GitHub Integration Layer for code commits and branch management
- Code organization aligned with the architectural design
