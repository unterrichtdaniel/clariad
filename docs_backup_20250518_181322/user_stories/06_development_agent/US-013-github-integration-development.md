# US-013: GitHub Integration for Development

**As a** software developer,
**I want** the Development agent to effectively use GitHub for code management
**So that** code changes are properly tracked and associated with user stories.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Feature Branch Creation
- Given a user story is selected for implementation
- When the Development agent begins work
- Then it should create a feature branch named according to conventions
- And associate it with the corresponding GitHub issue

### Scenario: Commit Organization
- Given code changes for a user story
- When the Development agent commits them
- Then it should create logical, focused commits
- And include descriptive commit messages referencing the issue

### Scenario: Existing Code Integration
- Given an existing codebase
- When the Development agent implements a new feature
- Then it should properly integrate with existing code
- And maintain consistency with the established patterns and styles

### Scenario: Pull Request Creation
- Given implementation of a user story is complete
- When the Development agent finalizes the work
- Then it should create a pull request
- And include a comprehensive description linking to the user story and summarizing changes

### Scenario: Definition of Done Verification
- Given development work is complete
- When the Development agent prepares for review
- Then it should verify all Definition of Done criteria are met
- And address any deficiencies before submitting the PR

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Branch naming conventions are defined
- [x] Commit message standards are documented
- [x] Code integration guidelines are specified
- [x] PR creation process is established
- [x] DoD verification checklist is available

## Technical Notes

This user story enhances the Test-First Implementation (US-012) by focusing on the GitHub integration aspects of the development process. The Development agent must follow proper version control practices, including branch management, atomic commits with meaningful messages, and well-structured pull requests. This ensures traceability between code changes and the corresponding user stories.

- Development Agent component in the system architecture
- GitHub Integration Layer for repository operations
- Code Repository Management functionality (US-021)
