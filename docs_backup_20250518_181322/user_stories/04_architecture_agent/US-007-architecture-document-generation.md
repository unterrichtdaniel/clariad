# US-007: Architecture Document Generation

**As a** software architect,
**I want** the Architecture agent to create well-structured architecture documents
**So that** the development team has clear technical guidance for implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: System Component Identification
- Given the Vision & Scope document
- When the Architecture agent analyzes requirements
- Then it should identify all major system components
- And document their responsibilities and relationships

### Scenario: Architecture Overview Creation
- Given the identified system components
- When the Architecture agent designs the overall structure
- Then it should create a clear architectural overview
- And include appropriate diagrams using Mermaid syntax

### Scenario: Technology Stack Selection
- Given the system requirements and constraints
- When the Architecture agent determines the technology stack
- Then it should document all selected technologies
- And provide rationale for each selection

### Scenario: Integration Point Documentation
- Given the system's external dependencies
- When the Architecture agent defines integration points
- Then it should document all APIs, protocols, and data formats
- And specify requirements for each integration

### Scenario: Non-Functional Requirements Mapping
- Given non-functional requirements from the Vision document
- When the Architecture agent designs the system
- Then it should ensure the architecture addresses all non-functional requirements
- And document how each requirement is satisfied

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Architecture document template is defined
- [x] Component identification approach is documented
- [x] Diagram format standards are established
- [x] Technology selection criteria are specified
- [x] Non-functional requirements are available

## Technical Notes

This user story follows the Vision Document Creation (US-005) in the workflow. The Architecture agent needs to retrieve the vision document from semantic memory, analyze requirements, and create a comprehensive architecture document with appropriate diagrams. The agent should use Mermaid syntax for creating architecture diagrams that will render properly in GitHub markdown.

- Semantic Memory System for retrieving vision documents and storing architecture documents
- GitHub Integration Layer for committing the document
