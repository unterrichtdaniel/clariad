# US-003: Agent Workflow Orchestration

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a robust LangGraph orchestrator to coordinate the agent workflow
**So that** agents work in the correct sequence with proper context sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Sequential Agent Execution
- Given the system receives a request to process a new project
- When the orchestrator begins execution
- Then it should activate agents in the defined sequence: Vision → Architecture → Task → Development → Review → Deployment → Feedback
- And pass relevant context between them

### Scenario: Conditional Branching
- Given the Review agent finds issues with the code
- When it reports these issues to the orchestrator
- Then the orchestrator should route back to the Development agent
- And provide the review feedback as context

### Scenario: State Persistence
- Given an agent has completed its task
- When it produces output artifacts
- Then the orchestrator should persist these in the semantic memory
- And make them available to subsequent agents

### Scenario: Error Handling
- Given an agent encounters a blocking error
- When it reports this to the orchestrator
- Then the orchestrator should implement the appropriate error handling strategy
- And either retry, route to an alternative path, or notify the user

### Scenario: Iteration Management
- Given the Feedback agent has completed its analysis
- When a new iteration is requested
- Then the orchestrator should route back to the appropriate starting point
- And preserve relevant context from the previous iteration

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [x] Agent sequence is clearly defined
- [x] State transition rules are documented
- [x] Context sharing requirements are specified
- [x] Error handling strategies are determined
- [x] Iteration pathways are mapped out

## Technical Notes

This is a foundational user story that defines the core workflow orchestration of the Clariad system. It will require implementing a directed graph of agent nodes using LangGraph, with clearly defined transition rules between states. The orchestrator must manage the flow of information between agents and handle both normal and exceptional execution paths.
