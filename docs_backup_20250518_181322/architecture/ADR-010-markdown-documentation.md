# ADR-010: Markdown as Documentation Format

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem requires a standardized format for all documentation artifacts produced by agents. The choice of documentation format impacts readability, version control, integration with GitHub, and overall system consistency.

## Decision

We will use Markdown (.md) as the standard format for all documentation artifacts created by the Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **HTML**: Using HTML for richer formatting capabilities.
   - Pros: More expressive formatting, interactive elements, direct web rendering.
   - Cons: More verbose, harder to edit directly, poorer diff visualization, more complex.

2. **Plain Text**: Using simple .txt files for maximum simplicity.
   - Pros: Universal compatibility, extreme simplicity.
   - Cons: Limited formatting, poor structure, no highlighting or links.

3. **Rich Text Formats**: Using formats like .docx or .pdf.
   - Pros: Rich formatting, widely used in business contexts.
   - Cons: Poor version control, binary formats, requires specialized editors.

4. **AsciiDoc/ReStructuredText**: Using alternative markup languages.
   - Pros: More features than Markdown, better for large technical documentation.
   - Cons: Less widespread adoption, steeper learning curve, more complex.

## Decision Drivers

1. **GitHub Integration**: Native support in GitHub for rendering and diffing.
2. **Readability**: Both human-readable as source and when rendered.
3. **Simplicity**: Easy to write and maintain without specialized tools.
4. **Version Control**: Works well with Git for tracking changes.
5. **Structure**: Sufficient structure for organized documentation.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Perfect integration with GitHub (preview, rendering, diffing)
- Easy to read both as source code and rendered format
- Simple syntax with low learning curve
- Excellent version control properties (line-based diffs)
- Support for essential formatting (headers, lists, code blocks, links)
- Wide adoption and tooling support
- Compatible with automated generation and processing

### Negative

- Limited advanced formatting compared to HTML or rich text
- Some inconsistencies across Markdown flavors
- Challenges with complex tables or advanced layouts
- Limited support for interactive elements
- May require additional tools for specialized content (diagrams, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Markdown Flavor

- We will use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) as the standard flavor
- This provides a good balance of features while ensuring GitHub compatibility

### Content Organization

- Each document will include a clear title as a level-1 heading
- Standard sections will use level-2 headings
- Subsections will use level-3 and level-4 headings as needed
- Documents will include appropriate metadata (date, version, author)

### Advanced Features

- For diagrams, we will use Mermaid code blocks (supported by GitHub)
- For tables, we will use standard Markdown table syntax
- For mathematical content, we will use GitHub-supported LaTeX syntax

### File Organization

- All documentation will be stored in the docs/ directory
- Subdirectories will be used for categorization (architecture/, user-stories/, etc.)
- File naming will follow kebab-case convention (e.g., vision-and-scope.md)
- ADRs will follow a numbered prefix convention (e.g., ADR-001-title.md)

### Documentation Generation

- Each agent will generate Markdown files according to standardized templates
- Templates will be version-controlled to ensure consistency
- Automated validation can be implemented to ensure structural compliance
