# ADR-005: GitHub Integration Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem requires deep integration with GitHub to store all artifacts, manage code, and facilitate collaboration. This integration is central to the system's ability to function within existing software development workflows.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive GitHub integration layer using LangChain's GitHub toolkit, allowing agents to interact directly with repositories for document creation, code management, and issue tracking.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Local File System Only**: Operating only on local files without GitHub integration.
   - Pros: Simplicity, no external dependencies, faster operations.
   - Cons: No collaboration, poor version tracking, limited persistence.

2. **Multiple VCS Support**: Supporting multiple version control systems (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
   - Pros: Broader applicability, flexibility for different teams.
   - Cons: Increased complexity, diluted development resources, maintenance burden.

3. **Minimal GitHub Integration**: Using GitHub only for final artifact storage.
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, fewer API calls.
   - Cons: Limited collaboration features, poor workflow integration, manual steps required.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Artifact Persistence**: Requirement to store all outputs in version-controlled repositories.
2. **Collaboration**: Support for team collaboration through standard GitHub workflows.
3. **Traceability**: Need for tracking changes and maintaining history.
4. **Workflow Integration**: Alignment with standard developer workflows.
5. **Tool Availability**: Availability of robust integration tools.

## Consequences

### Positive

- All agent artifacts are automatically stored in GitHub repositories
- Seamless integration with existing developer workflows
- Natural collaboration points for human developers
- Complete traceability of agent actions through commits and PRs
- Leverages GitHub's extensive collaboration features (issues, PRs, reviews)
- Enables version control and history tracking for all project artifacts

### Negative

- Dependency on GitHub API and potential rate limiting
- Requires GitHub access credentials and permissions management
- Additional complexity in handling GitHub-specific operations
- Potential for conflicting changes if humans and agents modify the same files
- Limited by GitHub API capabilities and response times

## Implementation Notes

- Use LangChain's GitHub toolkit for repository operations
- Implement read operations (get file, list files, search code) for context gathering
- Implement write operations (create/update files, create PRs) for agent outputs
- Use GitHub issues for task tracking, feedback, and follow-ups
- Document GitHub permission requirements for deployment
- Implement rate limiting and error handling for API resilience
- Use a dedicated bot account for agent actions to distinguish from human actions
