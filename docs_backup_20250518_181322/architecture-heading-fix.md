# Architecture.md Heading Structure Fix

The audit noted that Architecture.md has multiple sections formatted as H1 (using # Section Title for each major section). This means the file has several top-level headings, which is inconsistent with good documentation practice. Here's how to fix it:

## Current Structure (Problematic)

```markdown
# Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem: Architecture

## Overview & Context

...

# System Components & Responsibilities

...

# Data Flow & Component Interactions

...

# Technology Stack Choices

...

# Integration Points

...

# Risks & Mitigations

...

# Architecture Mapping to Requirements

...

# Definition of Done for Architecture

...

# Reference Architecture Diagram

...
```

## Recommended Structure (Fixed)

```markdown
# Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem: Architecture

## Overview & Context

...

## System Components & Responsibilities

...

## Data Flow & Component Interactions

...

## Technology Stack Choices

...

## Integration Points

...

## Risks & Mitigations

...

## Architecture Mapping to Requirements

...

## Definition of Done for Architecture

...

## Reference Architecture Diagram

...
```

## Steps to Fix

1. Open the Architecture.md file in your editor
2. Keep only the first heading as H1 (# Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem: Architecture)
3. Change all other H1 headings to H2 headings (replace # with ##)
4. Ensure any existing H2 headings under these sections become H3 headings (replace ## with ###)
5. Continue this pattern down the heading hierarchy
6. Save the file and verify the structure in a Markdown viewer

## Automation

You can fix this issue using the following sed command:

```bash
# Keep the first H1, convert others to H2
sed -i.bak '0,/^# /! s/^# /## /' docs/Architecture.md
```

Make sure to also update any H2 headings that are now under H2 sections:

```bash
# Find all H2 headings that follow another H2 heading and convert them to H3
sed -i.bak '/^## /,/^# /s/^## /### /' docs/Architecture.md
```

Review the results in a Markdown viewer to ensure the hierarchy makes sense.
