# Clariad AI Agent Ecosystem

An intelligent AI-driven workflow assistant that integrates seamlessly into existing software development processes, ensuring clarity, precision, and accelerated productivity across all stages of software creation.

## About Clariad

Clariad is a modular, robust, and maintainable multi-agent AI ecosystem that embeds Agile, BDD/TDD, and architectural best practices into software development workflows. Designed as an MCP extension for Claude Desktop, the system enables frictionless collaboration between human developers and specialized AI agents through clear task definitions, architectural rigor, and effective feedback loops.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Agent Ecosystem**: 7 specialized AI agents (Vision & Scope, Architecture, Task Refinement, Development, Review, Deployment, Feedback) working in concert
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub repositories for artifact generation and management
- **Agile/BDD/TDD Focus**: Built-in adherence to software development best practices
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Designed as an MCP extension that leverages Claude Desktop's existing LLM capabilities
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built with LangGraph and LangChain for maintainability and flexibility
